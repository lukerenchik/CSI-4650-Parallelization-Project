    "1. This implementation trains a deep learning model for the Hangman game using PyTorch on Google Colab.\n",
    "2. Training data is generated dynamically by simulating the game process, encoding word states and guessed letters.\n",
    "3. The model utilizes an LSTM architecture to predict the next letter during the game.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key Learnings and Thought Process:\n",
    "- Data Generation: Experimented with methods to generate balanced training samples, ensuring a diverse dataset for effective learning.\n",
    "- Training Pipeline: Gained experience in setting up PyTorch pipelines, including tensor creation, DataLoader usage, and batch processing.\n",
    "- Model Design: Used LSTM to capture the sequence nature of the game, learning the relationship between word states and guessed letters.\n",
    "\n",
    "Challenges and Future Improvements:\n",
    "1. The data generation process is time-intensive for larger datasets, motivating the need for optimization.\n",
